In this repository are files using the <strong>Ruby</strong> programming language,
That were/are part of my journey with language.

Among these files are:

 * Course Codes
 * Independent Questions
 * Challenges

<strong>Some courses and exercises use only Ruby, while others use Rails, they are separate for each one.</strong>

## Versions

The versions used for both Ruby and Rails are different depending on the course because they were made at different times and as new versions of the language and framework are released.

If you want to test the code, it is recommended to use the indicated version to avoid errors.

Ruby versions can be installed through the language's official website [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/).

The installed version can be viewed with the following command:

      ruby --version

Rails can be installed using this command:

      gem install rails

The installed version can be viewed with the following command:

      rails --version

Some [courses](https://github.com/rsmwall/ruby-study/tree/main/courses) used are free and easily accessible, in addition to being online, in video or text format. Others can be paid but can be accessed through the code in this repository, as I don't have the rights beyond the code I produced during the course. Paid courses are ticked.

The [challenges](https://github.com/rsmwall/ruby-study/tree/main/challenges) are usually larger and
more complex, some have their own repositories that will be referenced here.

- [uri](https://github.com/rsmwall/ruby-on-rails-studies/tree/main/challenges/uri)
- [quadratic-equation](https://github.com/rsmwall/ruby-on-rails-studies/blob/main/challenges/quadradic-equation.rb) (A solo challenge where the program is given a quadratic equation calculates using bhaskara's formula, and shows how many and what are the real roots of the equation.)
